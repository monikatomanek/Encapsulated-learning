## About

This is not a textbook. It’s not a dump of copy-paste tricks either. It’s a **living reference** for Python learners who want:

* Real examples, not abstract theory
* Organised structure instead of chaos
* Confidence instead of confusion

Whether you're just starting out or reviewing core skills, this repo is here to make things click.
