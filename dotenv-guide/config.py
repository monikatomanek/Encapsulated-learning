# Dotenv Guide - Managing Sensitive Information in Python Projects

This folder is part of the `Encapsulated-learning` repository by [Monika Tomanek](https://github.com/monikatomanek).

It contains a complete, beginner-friendly guide to setting up and using `.env` files securely in Python projects. These techniques help keep sensitive credentials like API keys and database passwords **out of your source code and off GitHub**.

## What's Inside

* `dotenv_guide.md` — A step-by-step walkthrough showing how to:

  * Store sensitive data in a `.env` file
  * Prevent Git from uploading it using `.gitignore`
  * Read `.env` values safely using the `dotenv` and `os` modules

## Use Case

This is essential knowledge for anyone working with:

* Databases
* APIs
* External services
* Deployable projects

## Why It Matters

Hardcoding secrets in your code is a common beginner mistake. This guide shows you how to avoid that by adopting a professional, secure practice for managing configuration.

## How to Use

1. Read `dotenv_guide.md`
2. Follow the setup instructions in your own project
3. Tell your future self: thank you
